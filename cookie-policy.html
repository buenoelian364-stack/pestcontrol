                <h2>What Are Cookies</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that websites place on visitor devices to store certain information. These files allow websites to recognize devices across visits and maintain basic functionality. Cookies contain data about website interaction but typically do not identify individuals by name unless combined with other information.</p>

                <p>This Cookie Policy explains what cookies this website uses, why we use them, and how visitors can manage their cookie preferences. Reading this policy alongside our Privacy Policy provides a complete understanding of how we handle visitor information.</p>

                <h2>Types of Cookies Used</h2>
                <p>This website uses only limited categories of cookies necessary for basic operation and functionality. We do not use advertising cookies, marketing cookies, social media cookies, or third-party tracking cookies.</p>

                <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies enable core website functionality including page navigation, form submission, and security features. Strictly necessary cookies cannot be disabled without severely affecting site usability. Examples include session management cookies that maintain your browsing session, security cookies that detect authentication abuse and protect user data, and load balancing cookies that distribute web traffic across servers.</p>

                <p>These cookies typically expire when you close your browser or after a short period of inactivity.</p>

                <h3>Functional Cookies</h3>
                <p>Functional cookies remember visitor preferences and choices to provide enhanced, personalized features. On this site, functional cookies may remember language preferences if multiple language options become available, store quiz responses temporarily during the session for display purposes only, and remember whether you have acknowledged informational messages or notices.</p>

                <p>These cookies improve user experience but are not essential for basic site operation. Disabling them may affect certain convenience features but will not prevent site access.</p>

                <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
                <p>We use limited analytics cookies to understand site usage patterns in aggregate form only. These cookies collect information about which pages visitors access, how long they stay on pages, and what paths they take through the site. All analytics data is anonymized and cannot identify individual visitors.</p>

                <p>Analytics information helps us identify which content is useful, detect technical issues, and understand general visitor behavior patterns. This improves our ability to organize and present information effectively.</p>

                <h2>Cookies We Do Not Use</h2>
                <p>To provide transparency about our practices, we explicitly state what types of cookies this website does not use:</p>

                <p>We do not use advertising cookies that track visitors across websites to build profiles for targeted advertising. We do not use marketing cookies that measure advertising campaign effectiveness. We do not use social media cookies that allow sharing to social platforms or track social media activity. We do not use third-party tracking cookies that allow external parties to collect information about visitors. We do not participate in remarketing or retargeting cookie networks. We do not use cross-site tracking technologies.</p>

                <h2>Cookie Duration</h2>
                <p>Cookies used on this site have different duration periods based on their purpose:</p>

                <p>Session cookies remain active only during your browsing session and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device for a specified period, typically ranging from a few days to several months, depending on the cookie's purpose. All persistent cookies used on this site have defined expiration dates and will be automatically removed after expiration.</p>

                <h2>First-Party vs Third-Party Cookies</h2>
                <p>This website uses only first-party cookies, which are set by this domain and used exclusively for this website's operation. We do not allow third-party cookies from external domains, advertising networks, or tracking services. This limits information sharing with external parties and provides visitors greater control over their privacy.</p>

                <h2>How to Manage Cookies</h2>
                <p>Visitors have several options for managing cookies on this website:</p>

                <h3>Browser Settings</h3>
                <p>All modern web browsers allow you to control cookie acceptance through browser settings. You can choose to block all cookies, accept only certain cookies, or receive notifications when cookies are being set. Browser help sections provide specific instructions for managing cookies in that browser.</p>

                <p>Blocking all cookies may prevent access to certain website features or limit functionality. Strictly necessary cookies may need to be enabled for the site to work properly.</p>

                <h3>Cookie Banner</h3>
                <p>When you first visit this site, you may see a cookie notification banner explaining cookie use. This banner allows you to accept cookies or access settings to customize your preferences. Your choice is stored so you will not see the banner on subsequent visits unless you clear your browser data.</p>

                <h3>Opt-Out Options</h3>
                <p>For analytics cookies, you can opt out through your browser settings or by using browser privacy modes such as incognito or private browsing. These modes typically prevent cookies from being stored permanently.</p>

                <h2>Global Privacy Control</h2>
                <p>This website respects Global Privacy Control signals where technically feasible. Global Privacy Control is a browser setting that automatically communicates your privacy preferences to websites. When we detect a Global Privacy Control signal from your browser, we will honor that preference by limiting non-essential cookies and data collection.</p>

                <p>To use Global Privacy Control, check if your browser supports this feature and enable it in your browser settings.</p>

                <h2>Withdrawing Consent</h2>
                <p>If you previously accepted cookies but wish to withdraw consent, you can do so by clearing cookies through your browser settings. Instructions for clearing cookies vary by browser but are typically found in privacy or history settings menus.</p>

                <p>After clearing cookies, you may see the cookie banner again on your next visit, allowing you to make a new choice about cookie acceptance.</p>

                <h2>Updates to Cookie Use</h2>
                <p>We may update our cookie practices to reflect changes in technology, legal requirements, or website functionality. Any changes to the types of cookies used or purposes for which they are used will be reflected in this Cookie Policy.</p>

                <p>The Last Updated date at the top of this policy indicates when changes were last made. We encourage visitors to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our cookie practices.</p>

                <h2>Impact of Disabling Cookies</h2>
                <p>Visitors should understand how disabling different cookie types may affect their site experience:</p>

                <p>Disabling strictly necessary cookies may prevent site access or cause significant functionality problems including inability to submit contact forms, loss of session continuity, and potential security vulnerabilities.</p>

                <p>Disabling functional cookies will not prevent site access but may require you to reset preferences on each visit and may limit access to enhanced features that improve convenience.</p>

                <p>Disabling analytics cookies will not affect your ability to access or use the site. Your visit will simply not contribute to aggregate usage statistics.</p>

                <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
                <p>Some browsers include Do Not Track features that signal websites not to track browsing activity. Due to lack of common industry interpretation of Do Not Track signals, this website currently does not respond to Do Not Track signals differently than described in this policy. However, we respect Global Privacy Control signals as described above and limit cookie use as outlined in this policy regardless of tracking preferences.</p>

                <h2>Mobile Device Cookies</h2>
                <p>When accessing this website through mobile devices, similar information storage technologies may be used. Mobile browsers provide cookie management options in their settings menus. The cookie practices described in this policy apply equally to desktop and mobile access.</p>

                <h2>Additional Information</h2>
                <p>For more information about cookies in general, including how they work and how to manage them, you can visit educational resources provided by browser manufacturers and privacy organizations. For information about how this website uses information collected through cookies, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>Contact Us</h2>
                <p>Questions about this Cookie Policy or how we use cookies should be directed to the email address or mailing address provided at the beginning of this policy. We will respond to inquiries about cookie practices within a reasonable time period.</p>
