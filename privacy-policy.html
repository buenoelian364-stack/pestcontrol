                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy describes how this website collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information from visitors. This policy applies to the website and all information collected through or submitted to this platform. We are committed to transparency regarding data practices and respecting visitor privacy rights under applicable United States federal and state laws.</p>

                <h2>Scope and Application</h2>
                <p>This policy covers personal information collected through this informational website. The site serves as an educational resource about household pest management and does not provide commercial services or transactions. Information collection is limited to what visitors voluntarily provide through contact forms and standard web server logging.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect several categories of information from website visitors:</p>

                <h3>Voluntarily Provided Information</h3>
                <p>When visitors use the contact form, they provide their name, email address, and message content. This information is collected only when visitors actively submit the form and is used solely to respond to their inquiries about website content or technical issues.</p>

                <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
                <p>Our web server automatically logs standard technical information including IP addresses, browser types, device information, operating systems, referring pages, pages visited, time stamps, and geographic location data derived from IP addresses. This logging occurs through normal web server operations and helps us maintain site functionality and security.</p>

                <h3>Quiz Responses</h3>
                <p>Information entered into the pest identification quiz on our website is processed locally in the visitor's browser and is not transmitted to our servers or stored by us. Quiz responses remain on the visitor's device only.</p>

                <h2>Sources of Information</h2>
                <p>Information comes directly from visitors when they submit contact forms or indirectly through automatic web server logging during site visits. We do not obtain information from third-party sources, data brokers, or other external parties.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
                <p>Information collected serves specific purposes:</p>

                <p>Contact form submissions allow us to respond to visitor inquiries about website content, address technical issues, and maintain communication regarding the informational resource. Server logs help us understand site usage patterns, identify technical problems, maintain security, prevent unauthorized access, and improve website functionality and content organization.</p>

                <p>We analyze aggregate visitor data to understand which content areas receive attention and to identify potential improvements to the informational resource. All analysis uses anonymized, aggregated data that cannot identify individual visitors.</p>

                <h2>Retention of Information</h2>
                <p>Contact form submissions are retained for the period necessary to respond to inquiries and maintain communication records, typically not exceeding two years unless ongoing correspondence necessitates longer retention. Server logs are maintained for security and operational purposes, with routine deletion of logs older than ninety days unless specific security incidents require extended retention for investigation.</p>

                <p>Visitors may request deletion of their contact form submissions by contacting us at the email address provided above. Such requests will be honored within thirty days unless legal obligations require retention.</p>

                <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

These providers are contractually obligated to maintain confidentiality and use information only for providing their services.</p>

                <p>Information may be disclosed if required by law, court order, or other legal process, or when we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect rights and property, prevent fraud or abuse, or respond to emergency situations involving safety.</p>
